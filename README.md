# realtime-chess-ai

This is a part of our final project submission. We have created a Chess AI by using training a CNN to score a board while time a reference from stockfish. 

Using this score and a minimax based search, the AI generated a move. We also have an interface designed to showcase these moves.

We are using parallel GPU compute to make the bot play chess at a very fast pace. We also go over all the algorithms required to implement this.
